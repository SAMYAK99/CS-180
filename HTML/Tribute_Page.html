            <p>
                &#x261B; A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931,
                in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>

                &#x261B; He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>

                &#x261B; Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and
                in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). <br><br>

                &#x261B; In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of
                the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.<br><br>

                &#x261B; Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
                successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <strong>“Missile Man.”</strong> <br><br>

                &#x261B; Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
                incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.<br><br>

                &#x261B; He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br>

                &#x261B; From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
                principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.<br><br>

                &#x261B; His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear
                power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the
                international community.<br><br>

                &#x261B; In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years.
                The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology
                as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.<br><br>

                &#x261B; Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of
                India honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b>
                for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.<br><br>

                &#x261B; In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution
                to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.<br><br>

                &#x261B; In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to
                recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".<br><br>

                &#x261B; While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                died from an
                apparent cardiac arrest on <b>27 July 2015</b> , aged 83.<br><br>

                &#x261B; Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in
                September 2015.<br><br>

                &#x261B; A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
                in August 2015.<br><br>

                &#x261B; In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant
                species as Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.<br><br><br>
