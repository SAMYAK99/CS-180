                    What is C++?
                </header>
                <p>
                    C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive
                    programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots
                    of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. C++ is an efficient and powerful language and finds
                    wide use in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and real-time simulations. Because of the inclusion
                    of rich function libraries, working in C++ becomes simpler and convenient than C. Being
                    object-oriented programming like Java, C++ provides the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                    encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows exception handling and function overloading.

                <p>he “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any programming language and also one of
                    the simplest programs you will learn. All you have to do is display the message “Hello World” on the
                    screen.
                    <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
                </p>

                    #include<iostream>  
                    <br>
                    using namespace std;

                <p>
                    Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented
                    programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in
                    programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
                </p>
                <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An
                    Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it
                    is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
                    <br>
                    <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is
                    a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be
                    accessed & used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.
                    For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but
                    all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit,
                    Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.

                <header>
                    Inheritance
                </header>
                <p>
                    The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called
                    Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived
                    Class.Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or
                    Super class. Using inheritance, we have to write the functions only one time instead of three
                    times as we have inherited rest of the three classes from base class(Vehicle).
                </p>
                <p> <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

                    <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of
                    the base
                    class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become
                    protected in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public
                    member and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member
                    and protected members of the base class will become Private in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one
                    class. i.e. one sub class is inherited by one base class only.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit
                    from more than one classes. i.e one sub class is inherited from more than one base classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another
                    derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hierarical Inheritance :</b> In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inherited
                    from a single base class i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b> Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one
                    type of inheritance. For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

                    Polymorphism
                </header>
                <p>
                    The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the
                    ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This
                    is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.
                    <br>
                    <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</b>
                    <br>
                    1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
                    2. Runtime Polymorphism

                </p>
                <p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator
                    overloading.<br>
                    Runtime polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.

                    Abstraction
                </header>
                <p>
                    Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming
                    in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data
                    abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world,
                    hiding the background details or implementation.
                    <br>
                    Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                    accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not
                    know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the
                    inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what
                    abstraction is.
                </p>
                <p><b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. Class helps us
                    to
                    group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide which
                    data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
                    <br>
                    <b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For
                    example,
                    consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as
                    arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.
                    <br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:</b><br>

                    1. Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code.<br>
                    2. Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.<br>
                    3. Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.<br>
                    4. Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to
                    the user.

            <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
                <header>
                    Encapsulation
                </header>
                <p>
                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit.
                    In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the
                    functions that manipulates them. Consider a real life example of encapsulation, in a company there
                    are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc.
                    The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keep records of all the data related
                    to finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related activities and keep records
                    of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from finance
                    section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                    directly access the data of sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the
                    sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is.
                    Here the data of sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a
                    single name “sales section”.
                <p>Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data. In
                    the above example the data of any of the section like sales, finance or accounts is hidden from any
                    other section.<br>
                    In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers.</p>
