"""
CLI based encryption to encrypt every file in specified directory and it's sub directory.
Generate Key for encryption and decryption.
Encrypt with generated key, files need to be decrypted with the same key used for encryption. If same key not provided error will be raised
Same key can be used to encrypt multiple files, multiple times.
