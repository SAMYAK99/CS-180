/*  Basic intuition that comes to our mind is to sort the array and after sorting we can simply traverse to check the presence of duplicates*/
/*This approach will require the complexity of O(nlogn) but it will distort the array and the space complexity required will be O(1)*/


/* Intuition 2  : */ 
/* Inorder to reduce the time complexity we will have to adjust with the space complexity and that can be done with the help of maintaining a frequency array which
will be initially marked with all zero's and then we can traverse and add 1 whenever we find that number if that one gets updated to 2 then those are the duplicated */
/* Though the time complexity is O(N) but the space complexity is also O(N) */

/* Can we come up with a solution which will  utilize O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity */

1) place Fast and slow pointer at the start.
2) Move fast by two steps and slow by one.
3) At one point the will form a cycle since duplicates are present.
4) Once the duplicates are found you can simply place the fast pointer at the start and iterate again one step at a time for both fast and slow pointer.
5) Do this till fast != slow .*/
